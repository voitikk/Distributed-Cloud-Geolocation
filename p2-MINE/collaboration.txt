Alex Voitik
Project 2 Checkpoint

I have spent 6-7 hours on this project so far. I have code in my pinger.py file,
as well as my central.py file. The code is not complete, but I have a plan for 
completion in the next week. I have read over the project specification, and I 
now fully understand what is needed to complete this project. I would like to 
implement some of the extra credit to earn a few points, but only after I am 100%
sure that my code works properly. I have also begun the process of using the 
EC2 and GCE machines.

I was not able to begin working diligently on this project due to the lack of
internet I had while in Los Angeles. The hotels we stayed at were charging $20
a day for use of the internet, so it was hard to get started. I worked mainly on this
today, and a little bit on the red-eye we took Sunday/Monday morning. 

Once again, I do plan on working very hard on this for the next week and I will
complete it, even if it means there will be a lot more work for me to do.


As far as code is concerned, I only used the webserver code you emailed us from the last project, as well as my own copy of the project. I also used the python documentation found online.
